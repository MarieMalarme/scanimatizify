# Scanimatizify

A little web-based tool to morph & animate 2 SVG shapes by interpolating the paths, & convert the output to 2 printable files to create a scanimation.

Try it out live [here](https://scanimatizify.studiodev.xyz/)!

## What is a scanimation?

You can find a brief explanation on [the Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barrier-grid_animation_and_stereography).
I discovered this technique thanks to [Takahiro Kurashima's books series "Poemotion"](https://www.lars-mueller-publishers.com/tags/poemotion).

## Customizable settings

The following scanimation settings can be customized:

- Dimensions in pixels
- Render resolution in DPI
- Frames amount
- Loop the animation
- Slice width in pixels
- Animation orientation

The following path settings can be customized:

- Fill color
- Blur effect size

## Output files

The 2 files to download consist in:

- A layer with the different animation frames sliced and superposed in alternance ; to be printed on any support
- A layer with a grid, showing only one serie of frames at a time, and hiding the others ; to be printed on a transparent film that will be moved on top of the sliced frames layer
